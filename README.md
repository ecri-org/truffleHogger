# truffleHogger

This is a fork of [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) but with several modifications that make it even more useful.

"Searches through git repositories for secrets, digging deep into commit history and branches. This is effective at finding secrets accidentally committed."

## Modifications

### Warning

> Warning: While we try to mask data when found it may not be perfect. This is why diffs are by default not printed.

### Forked Features

New features added:
  - handles the new [GitHub authentication token formats](https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentication-token-formats/)
  - some code was reformatted to python standard (spacing, naming).
  - by default the application will mask passwords (see `--show-secrets` if you would rather see them).
  - a new arg `--show-secrets` will show secrets found, by default will NOT show secrets.
  - a new arg `--print-diff` will print the diff. By default, the diff is not printed for better security (questionable) if unknown or uncontrolled logging is being done. The output will always include the file where a secret is found. This works to suppress the diff field even in json output!
  - temporary files are no longer created for security, thus also no cleanup.
  - the cleanup flag is now removed, cleanup is no longer required.
  - a summary is printed when `--json` is used.
  - a summary is printed when `--json` and `--json-streaming` is used, however we remove the `foundIssues` key as they would have been previously streamed.
  - results are no longer streaming to stdout by default when using `--json`, and json output is done at the end (though this usually needs more memory, I've eliminated some structures that were being stored). This _could_ be problematic with extremely large repositories. The benefit is that the json output can now be parsed as a single result. Use streaming option if you wish not t batch. 
  - a new arg `--json-streaming` allows streaming json results, requires also specifying the `--json` arg, useful for piping commands. Note that this will no longer be the typical 'finalized' json object you'd expect.
  - no longer print or store the blob diff, we only now store the masked diff.
  - remove project_path from output for security.
  - no longer depends on truffleHogRegexes, it is now embedded under 'truffleHogger'.
  - version is bumped to `version='3.0.0'`, and the name changed from `truffleHog` to `truffleHogger`.
  - the commit message for each result is truncated to 120 characters.
  - when specifying `--branch` the branch name is explicitly what was used instead of 'FETCH_HEAD' which made the output confusing.
  - new arg `--entropy_threshold_base64`, allows tuning of base64 threshold, default is set to 4.5.
  - new arg `--entropy_threshold_hex`, allows tuning of hex threshold, default is set to 3.0.
  - new arg `--length_threshold`, allows specifying the minimum length of words which will be scanned for entropy, default is set to 20.
  - line numbers will be output in both standard output and in json when requested
  - regex checks use same logic as entropy, enabling calculation of line numbers
  - add new arg `--suppress-summary` for those that don't require the summary output (meant to be used with `--json`)
  - add new arg `--color` that allows printing text results in color. This feature was previously the default behavior but has now been made optional
  - add new arg `--max_line_length_threshold <int>` to limit evaluating lines longer than this, i.e. longer lines signal code which is not human readable (minified code)
  - add new arg `--human-readable-only` to only evaluate human-readable code (using basic techniques described later), and using mmap temp files
  - add new arg `--show-hr-ignored-files` to show files which were thrown out as they were deemed not human-readable
## Docker

We build an image that you can use: `docker pull ghcr.io/ecri-org/trufflehogger:latest`


### Development

All branches run the test actions.
Tagging build and release a container. To release a version the prefix must be start with `v`. For example, `v3.0.0`
When versioning change version in the `version` file. This will drive versioning throughout the build and container building pipelines.

> Note: the build version `Dockerfile` is set up as an arg with a default value, if the build is working correctly the proper values should be passed through (read from the `version` file).


# Original Readme

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dxa4481/truffleHog/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dxa4481/truffleHog)

Searches through git repositories for secrets, digging deep into commit history and branches. This is effective at finding secrets accidentally committed.

## NEW
truffleHog previously functioned by running entropy checks on git diffs. This functionality still exists, but high signal regex checks have been added, and the ability to suppress entropy checking has also been added.


```
truffleHog --regex --entropy=False https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog.git
```

or

```
truffleHog file:///user/dxa4481/codeprojects/truffleHog/
```

With the `--include_paths` and `--exclude_paths` options, it is also possible to limit scanning to a subset of objects in the Git history by defining regular expressions (one per line) in a file to match the targeted object paths. To illustrate, see the example include and exclude files below:

_include-patterns.txt:_
```ini
src/
# lines beginning with "#" are treated as comments and are ignored
gradle/
# regexes must match the entire path, but can use python's regex syntax for
# case-insensitive matching and other advanced options
(?i).*\.(properties|conf|ini|txt|y(a)?ml)$
(.*/)?id_[rd]sa$
```

_exclude-patterns.txt:_
```ini
(.*/)?\.classpath$
.*\.jmx$
(.*/)?test/(.*/)?resources/
```

These filter files could then be applied by:
```bash
trufflehog --include_paths include-patterns.txt --exclude_paths exclude-patterns.txt file://path/to/my/repo.git
```
With these filters, issues found in files in the root-level `src` directory would be reported, unless they had the `.classpath` or `.jmx` extension, or if they were found in the `src/test/dev/resources/` directory, for example. Additional usage information is provided when calling `trufflehog` with the `-h` or `--help` options.

These features help cut down on noise, and makes the tool easier to shove into a devops pipeline.

## Install
```
pip install truffleHog
```

## Customizing

Custom regexes can be added with the following flag `--rules /path/to/rules`. This should be a json file of the following format:
```
{
    "RSA private key": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
```
Things like subdomain enumeration, s3 bucket detection, and other useful regexes highly custom to the situation can be added.

Feel free to also contribute high signal regexes upstream that you think will benefit the community. Things like Azure keys, Twilio keys, Google Compute keys, are welcome, provided a high signal regex can be constructed.

trufflehog's base rule set sources from https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHogRegexes/blob/master/truffleHogRegexes/regexes.json

To explicitly allow particular secrets (e.g. self-signed keys used only for local testing) you can provide an allow list `--allow /path/to/allow` in the following format:
```
{
    "local self signed test key": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nfoobar123\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----",
    "git cherry pick SHAs": "regex:Cherry picked from .*",
}
```

Note that values beginning with `regex:` will be used as regular expressions. Values without this will be literal, with some automatic conversions (e.g. flexible newlines).

## How it works
This module will go through the entire commit history of each branch, and check each diff from each commit, and check for secrets. This is both by regex and by entropy. For entropy checks, truffleHog will evaluate the shannon entropy for both the base64 char set and hexidecimal char set for every blob of text greater than 20 characters comprised of those character sets in each diff. If at any point a high entropy string >20 characters is detected, it will print to the screen.

                        comments and are ignored. If empty or not provided
                        (default), no Git object paths are excluded unless
                        effectively excluded via the --include_paths option.
```

## Running with Docker

First, enter the directory containing the git repository

```
cd /path/to/git
```

To launch the trufflehog with the docker image, run the following"

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/proj" dxa4481/trufflehog file:///proj
```

`-v` mounts the current working dir (`pwd`) to the `/proj` dir in the Docker container

`file:///proj` references that very same `/proj` dir in the container (which is also set as the default working dir in the Dockerfile)

## Wishlist

- ~~A way to detect and not scan binary diffs~~
- ~~Don't rescan diffs if already looked at in another branch~~
- ~~A since commit X feature~~
- ~~Print the file affected~~
